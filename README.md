# ciphertext

> A personal encryptor and decryptor

I am trying to learn more about cryptography with how it works and ways to implement it.

## To run:


Currently there are 2 main scripts in the `src` folder. `basic.py` and `shifting.py`. 

- Add the plain text to the 'plaintext.txt' file in the parent directory.
- You can set the `key` to a custom int. There is a diffrent key in each script.

## Run

```
python src/basic.py
```
OR
```
python src/shifting.py
```
